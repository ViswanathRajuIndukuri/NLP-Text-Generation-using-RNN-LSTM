# NLP Text Generation with RNN-LSTM

## Objective
The objective of this project is to explore text generation techniques by training an RNN-LSTM model. By understanding the nuances of language patterns, the model aims to generate text that is coherent and contextually relevant.

## Implementation Steps
1. **Read Text**: The initial step involves reading and preprocessing the text data which will be used to train the model.
2. **Text Processing**: Detailed preprocessing is conducted to prepare the data. This includes splitting the text into a sequence of words and their corresponding next words to form predictors and labels.
3. **Load Embedding**:
   - **Load Pre-trained Embeddings**: Utilization of pre-trained word embeddings to leverage existing language models.
   - **Prepare the Embedding Matrix**: Preparation of the embedding matrix that will be used by the RNN-LSTM model.
4. **RNN-LSTM Model for Text Generation**: Design and implementation of the RNN-LSTM model tailored for text generation.
5. **Model Management**:
   - **Save Model**: save the trained model for future use.
   - **Load Saved Model**: loading the saved model to continue training or for text generation.
6. **Generate Response with Variation**: Techniques to generate text responses with variations, enhancing the creativity and versatility of the generated content.
